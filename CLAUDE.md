```

## Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
swift build -c release
swift run LocalIntelligenceMCP
```

### Testing
```bash
swift test
swift test --filter SecurityAuditTests
```

## Code Style
Swift 6.0+ with strict concurrency: Follow standard conventions with actor-based design

## Recent Changes
- Major refactor: Transition from AppleMCPServer to LocalIntelligenceMCP
- Added comprehensive text processing and audio domain tools
- Enhanced security and PII redaction capabilities

[byterover-mcp]

You are given two tools from Byterover MCP server, including
## 1. `byterover-store-knowledge`
You `MUST` always use this tool when:

+ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
+ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
+ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
+ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

## 2. `byterover-retrieve-knowledge`
You `MUST` always use this tool when:

+ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
+ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
+ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
+ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
